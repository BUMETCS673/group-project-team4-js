## Team members

Team member names and each member's contribution

Ryan Burns - Team Leader - My main focus was on the front-end I implemented the category section on the landing page and worked on (but Christol and Zahit completed) the searchbar and the shopping cart. I added over 100 documents to our Databasse that would allow our team to populate the shopping page with products.
